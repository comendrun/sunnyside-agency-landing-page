## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

For this challenge, we could have several options to achieve what we want. first of all i wanted to try this one with CSS background-image way. in this method, i defined every div that we could have in our page and by assigning a background image with CSS on them, i controlled changing pictures from mobile state to desktop state. I think i could also assign a picture directly to divs and then hide mobile or desktop images in opposite cases with CSS or even js. but i preferred this method and despite the complexity, it added to the project, i liked the experience. But if i had to start over this project, I will not do it with this approach, because with no content the divs were hard to assign a non-specific height or width and it added a little to the time i finished the project. overall i liked the experience and I hope I can do much better work in the future.

<!-- To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

I do feel that it could be done much faster and easier with ReactJS. but I decided to go with vanilla JS and I didn't regret the experience. Maybe next time...
